<p style="text-align:left">I’m a Interaction and Identity Designer with an interest in building user centered digital products. For over 2 years, I’ve been helping businesses create consistent visual communication strategies. I also do branding & identity, photography & video for brands and events.

When I’m not on the job, I'm working my way through every recipe in my pinterest feed 🍔 and planning trips to new and exciting places ✈️.</p></th>
