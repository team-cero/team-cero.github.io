      <p> Dear Batch#9! I'm Robert and happy to start with all of you the new challange. I'm working at NOKIA as Innovation Manager and now  here in DPS as product manager :-) In the problem space I work together with Christine from ADAC and a very exiting and talented team from around the world and we will try to motivate car drivers, who are already moveing eco-friendly, to reduce their carbon footprint. I love my family, hiking, skiing and I am happy to get to know always new people and stuff. :-) </p>
