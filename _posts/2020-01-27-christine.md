      <p> Dear Batch#9! I'm Christine and I am happy to meet all of you. I work at ADAC Versicherungen in the marketing department and now I am here as product manager :-) I will try to motivate car drivers, for whom it is already important to move eco-friendly, to reduce their carbon footprint. I love travelling 🏝️ and doing yoga 🧘. </p>
